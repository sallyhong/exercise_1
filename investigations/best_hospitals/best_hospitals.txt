Question 1

---
What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the 
most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures?
---


There are many ways to define "high-quality care". To me, if a hospital are to be
"models", they should exhibit better than average for various procedures. 
This weighting system favors hospitals of general care rather than specialized small
ones. However, I chose this method as it is generic and selects "overall models".

This was my logic.

	A. From "Timely and Effective Care":

		1. Remove all emergency measures. 
			This was more for convenience as the scores
			were in strings. The difficulty of analyzing and restructuring the queries to
			accommodate emergency measures outweighed the impact of it on the overall
			results.
		2. Remove "Not Available" scores and those that measure ID that are "lower is better"
			as well as those with footnotes (which mostly indicate there are not enough
			samples) and focus on the the measures where higher scores are better for 
			analysis.
		3. Sort by Score, grouped by Measure ID
		4. Determine the average score by Measure ID
		5. Filter out those that have higher than average.
			This was to keep only those that had higher than average for that Measure ID.
		6. Count the number of times each hospital appears. 
		7. Divide (6) by total number of measures available -- 51 from the reference sheet.

	B. From "Readmissions and Deaths"

		1. Filter only those with "better than national average".
		2. Count the number of times each hospital appears
		3. Divide (2) by total number of measures available 

	C. 

		1. Add the results from (6A) and (6B)
		2. Sort



This assumes equal weight to "Timely and Effective Care" and "Readmissions and Deaths"
as well as equal weight to every Measure ID. In reality, if there are more Measure IDs for
similar topic, the individual Measure IDs should carry less weight. However, this method
does not account for fine details like that.

If I were to run a serious experiment, I'd probably send a survey out to doctors and
hospital administrators over the country to figure out more precise weights.

We see some big name hospitals in this list such as #8 Mayo Clinic Hospital and #9 Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center. Many of the other hospitals rank regionally within their state.
This list contains hospitals that consistently rank better than average on many procedures,
providing to be a good model for other hospitals.
