Question 4

---
Are average scores for hospital quality and procedural variability correlated with patient survey response?
---


I used the HCAHPS Base Score from the patient survey.

I interpreted this question as two part.

I. Find if there is correlation between average scores for hospital quality and patient survey
II. Find if there is correlation between procedural variability in a hospital  and patient survey.


For I.

	1. From "Timely and Effective Care"
		A. Only select hospital with 20+ measurements
			This is to weed out hospitals that have a perfect score but for one measurement
		B. Average the score amongst the measurements per hospital
	2. 
		A. Determine the Pearson correlation coefficient between the average scores and the patient
		survey.


For II.

	1. From "Timely and Effective Care"
		A. Count the number of procedures per hospital. (Higher count means higher procedural variability.)
	2.
		A. Determine the Pearson correlation coefficient between the procedural variability
		and the patient survey.



A Pearson correlation coefficient of +1 is a strong positive linear relationship whereas closer to
-1 suggests a strong negative linear relationship. A value near zero indicates no linear 
relationship.

RESULTS

I. hospavgcorr: 0.23345865203447996

	There is a slight positive correlation between average scores of hospital quality and patient
	survey score.

II. hospmeascorr: -0.14096513494477603

	There is a slight negative correlation between the procedural variability in a hospital and
	patient survey. This makes sense from our data because often times there are hospitals with 
	only one procedure with very high scores.
